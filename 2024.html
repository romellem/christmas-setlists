        <h2>You‚Äôre a Mean One, Mr. Grinch</h2>
        [Verse 1]<br>
        You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch<br>
        You really are a heel<br>
        You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch<br>
        You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2]<br>
        You're a monster, Mr. Grinch<br>
        Your heart's an empty hole<br>
        Your brain is full of spiders, you've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch<br>
        I wouldn't touch you with a thirty-nine-and-a-half-foot pole<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 3]<br>
        You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch<br>
        You have termites in your smile<br>
        You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch<br>
        Given a choice between the two of you<br>
        I'd take the seasick crocodile<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 4]<br>
        You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch<br>
        You're a nasty-wasty skunk<br>
        Your heart is full of unwashed socks, your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch<br>
        The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote, "Stink, stank, stunk"<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 5]<br>
        You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch<br>
        You're the king of sinful sots<br>
        Your heart's a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch<br>
        Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable<br>
        Mangled up in tangled up knots<br>

        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
        Everywhere you go;<br>

        It's glistening once again<br>
        With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.<br>
        <br>

        On your own front door.<br>
        <br>
        A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots<br>
        Is the wish of Barney and Ben;<br>
        Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk<br>
        Is the hope of Janice and Jen;<br>
        And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.<br>
        <br>
        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
        Everywhere you go;<br>
        There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,<br>
        It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.<br>
        <br>
        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;<br>
        Soon the bells will start,<br>
        And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing<br>
        Right within your heart<br>
        <br>
        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
        Toys in every store<br>

        But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas, my dear<br>
        Some time of year to be with the one you love<br>
        <br>
        So won't you tell me you'll never more roam?<br>
        Christmas and New Year's will find you home<br>
        There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain<br>
        And I'll be happy, happy once again<br>
        <br>
        Ooh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain<br>
        And I'll be happy, Christmas once again

        <h2>Alien For Christmas</h2>
        This year for Christmas<br>
        There's something I'd really like<br>
        So if you're up there somewhere Santa<br>
        Please don't bring me another bike<br>
        I don't need any ugly sweaters<br>
        And I don't play much basketball<br>
        But there's something kinda special<br>
        That I want most of all<br>
        <br>
        I want an Alien for Christmas<br>
        Bring me an alien this year<br>
        I want a little green guy<br>
        About three feet high<br>
        With seventeen eyes<br>
        Who knows how to fly<br>
        I want an alien for Christmas, this year<br>
        <br>
        He can live in the bathtub<br>
        So don't worry about a thing<br>
        And I'll take him out for walks<br>
        When it gets nicer in the spring<br>
        I'll always keep it company<br>
        It will never be alone<br>
        We can hang around the house all day<br>
        And watch the twilight zone<br>
        <br>
        I want an Alien for Christmas<br>
        Bring me an alien this year<br>
        I want a little green guy<br>
        About three feet high<br>

        <h2>Christmas Tree Farm</h2>
        My winter nights are taken up by static<br>
        Stress and holiday shopping traffic<br>
        But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else<br>
        Just like magic<br>
        <br>
        In my heart is a Christmas tree farm<br>
        Where the people would come<br>
        To dance under sparkling lights<br>
        Bundled up in their mittens and coats<br>
        And the cider would flow<br>
        And I just wanna be there tonight<br>
        <br>
        Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon<br>
        Mistakes are forgiven<br>
        And everything is icy and blue<br>
        And you would be there too<br>
        <br>
        Under the mistletoe<br>
        Watching the fire glow<br>
        And telling me, "I love you"<br>
        Just being in your arms<br>
        Takes me back to that little farm<br>
        Where every wish comes true<br>
        <br>
        In my heart is a Christmas tree farm<br>
        There's a light in the barn<br>
        We'd run inside out from the cold<br>
        In the town, kids are dreaming of sleighs<br>
        And they're warm and they're safe<br>
        They wake to see a blanket of snow<br>
        <br>
        Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon<br>
        Mistakes are forgiven<br>
        And everything is icy and blue<br>
        And you would be there too<br>
        <br>
        Under the mistletoe<br>
        Watching the fire glow<br>

        Just being in your arms<br>
        Takes me back to that little farm<br>
        Where every wish comes true<br>
        Baby, yeah<br>
        <br>
        And when I'm feeling alone<br>
        You remind me of home<br>
        Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        And when the world isn't fair<br>
        I'll pretend that we're there<br>
        Baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        (To you)<br>
        <br>
        Under the mistletoe (to you)<br>
        Watching the fire glow<br>

        Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (darling)<br>
        Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        I love you<br>

        Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul <br>
        With a corncob pipe and a button nose <br>
        And two eyes made out of coal <br>
        Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say <br>
        He was made of snow but the children know<br>
        that he came to life one day <br>
        There must have been some magic<br>
        in that old silk hat they found <br>
        For when they placed it on his head <br>
        He began to dance around <br>
        Frosty the snowman <br>
        Was alive as he could be <br>
        And the children say he could laugh and play<br>
        just the same as you and me <br>
        <br>
        (Thumpetty thump thump <br>

        Let's run and <br>
        We'll have some fun <br>
        Now before I melt away <br>
        Down to the village <br>
        With a broomstick in his hand <br>
        Running here and there all around the square<br>
        Saying <br>
        Catch me if you can <br>
        <br>
        (He led them down the streets of town <br>
        Right to the traffic cop <br>

        <h2>Run Rudolph Run</h2>
        Out of all the reindeers you know you're the mastermind<br>
        Run, run Rudolph, Randolph ain't too far behind<br>
        Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town<br>
        Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down<br>
        Run, run Rudolph 'cause I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round<br>
        <br>
        Said Santa to a boy child "What have you been longing for?"<br>
        "All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"<br>
        And then away went Rudolph a whizzing like a shooting star<br>
        Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town<br>
        Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down<br>
        Run, run Rudolph, reeling like a merry-go-round<br>
        <br>
        Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town<br>
        Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down<br>
        Run, run Rudolph 'I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round'<br>
        <br>
        Said Santa to a girl child "What would please you most to get?"<br>
        "A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"<br>
        And then away went Rudolph a whizzing like a Saber jet<br>
        Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town<br>
        Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down<br>
        Run, run Rudolph I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round
