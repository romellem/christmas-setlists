        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
        Everywhere you go;<br>
        Take a look at the five and ten<br>
        It's glistening once again<br>
        With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.<br>
        <br>
        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
        Toys in every store<br>
        But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be<br>
        On your own front door.<br>
        <br>
        A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots<br>
        Is the wish of Barney and Ben;<br>
        Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk<br>
        Is the hope of Janice and Jen;<br>
        And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.<br>
        <br>
        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
        Everywhere you go;<br>
        There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,<br>
        It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.<br>
        <br>
        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;<br>
        Soon the bells will start,<br>
        And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing<br>
        Right within your heart<br>
        <br>
        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
        Toys in every store<br>
        But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be<br>
        On your own front door.<br>
        <br>
        Sure it's Christmas once more...

        (Wonderland winter wonderland wonderland)<br>
        Sleigh bells ring are you listening<br>
        In the lane snow is glistening<br>
        A beautiful sight oh we're happy tonight<br>
        Walking in a winter wonderland<br>
        <br>
        Gone away is the bluebird<br>
        Here to stay is a new bird<br>
        He's singing a song as we go along<br>
        Walking in a winter wonderland<br>
        <br>
        Well in the meadow we can build a snowman<br>
        And pretend that he is Parson Brown<br>
        He'll say are you married we say no man<br>
        But you can do the job when you're in town<br>
        <br>
        Later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire<br>
        To face unafraid of the plans that we made<br>
        Walking in a winter wonderland<br>
        <br>
        (In the meadow we can build a snowman)<br>
        And pretend he's a circus clown<br>
        We have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman<br>
        Until the other kiddies knock him down<br>
        <br>
        Oh when it snows ain't it filling<br>
        Though your nose gets a chilling<br>
        We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way<br>
        Walking in a winter wonderland<br>
        <br>

        Grandma got run over by a reindeer<br>
        Walking home from our house Christmas Eve<br>
        You can say there's no such thing as Santa<br>
        But as for me and Grandpa, we believe<br>
        <br>
        She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog<br>
        And we'd begged her not to go<br>
        But she forgot her medication<br>
        And she staggered out the door into the snow<br>
        When we found her Christmas mornin'<br>
        At the scene of the attack<br>
        She had hoof prints on her forehead<br>
        And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back<br>
        <br>
        Grandma got run over by a reindeer<br>

        But as for me and Grandpa, we believe<br>
        (Lord, we believe)<br>
        <br>
        Now we're all so proud of Grandpa<br>
        He's been takin' this so well<br>
        See him in there watchin' football<br>
        Drinkin beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle<br>
        It's not Christmas without Grandma<br>
        All the family's dressed in black<br>
        And we just can't help but wonder:<br>
        Should we open up her gifts or send them back?<br>

        (Lord, we believe)<br>
        <br>
        Now the goose is on the table<br>
        And the pudding made of fig<br>
        And a blue and silver candle<br>
        That would have just matched the hair in grandma's wig<br>
        I've warned all my friends and neighbors<br>
        "Better watch out for yourselves<br>
        They should never give a license<br>
        To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves."<br>

        Sing it, Grandpa!<br>

        You know Dasher and Dancer<br>
        And Prancer and Vixen<br>
        Comet and Cupid<br>
        And Donner and Blitzen<br>
        But do you recall<br>
        The most famous reindeer of all?<br>
        <br>
        Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer<br>
        Had a very shiny nose<br>
        And if you ever saw it<br>
        You would even say it glows<br>
        <br>
        All of the other reindeer<br>
        Used to laugh and call him names<br>
        They never let poor Rudolph<br>
        Join in any reindeer games<br>
        <br>
        Then one foggy Christmas Eve<br>
        Santa came to say<br>
        "Rudolph with your nose so bright<br>
        Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"<br>
        <br>
        Then how the reindeer loved him<br>
        As they shouted out with glee<br>
        "Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer<br>
        You'll go down in history!"<br>
        <br>
        Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer<br>
        Had a very shiny nose<br>
        And if you ever saw it<br>
        You would even say it glows<br>
        <br>
        All of the other reindeer<br>
        Used to laugh and call him names<br>
        They never let poor Rudolph<br>
        Join in any reindeer games<br>
        <br>
        Then one foggy Christmas Eve<br>
        Santa came to say<br>
        "Rudolph with your nose so bright<br>
        Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"<br>
        <br>
        Then how the reindeer loved him<br>
        As they shouted out with glee<br>
        "Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer<br>
        You'll go down in history!"

        <h2 id="frosty-the-snowman">Frost The Snowman</h2>
        Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul <br>
        With a corncob pipe and a button nose <br>
        And two eyes made out of coal <br>
        Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say <br>
        He was made of snow but the children know<br>
        that he came to life one day <br>
        There must have been some magic<br>
        in that old silk hat they found <br>
        For when they placed it on his head <br>
        He began to dance around <br>
        Frosty the snowman <br>
        Was alive as he could be <br>
        And the children say he could laugh and play<br>
        just the same as you and me <br>
        <br>
        (Thumpetty thump thump <br>
        Thumpety thump thump <br>
        Look at Frosty go <br>
        Thumpetty thump thump <br>
        Thumpety thump thump <br>
        Over the hills of snow)<br>
        <br>
        Frosty the snowman knew <br>
        The sun was hot that day <br>
        So he said <br>
        Let's run and <br>
        We'll have some fun <br>
        Now before I melt away <br>
        Down to the village <br>
        With a broomstick in his hand <br>
        Running here and there all around the square<br>
        Saying <br>
        Catch me if you can <br>
        <br>
        (He led them down the streets of town <br>
        Right to the traffic cop <br>
        And he only paused a moment when <br>
        He heard him holler) "Stop!" <br>
        For Frosty the snow man <br>
        Had to hurry on his way <br>
        But he waved goodbye saying <br>
        Don't you cry <br>
        I'll be back again some day <br>
        I'll be back again some day
