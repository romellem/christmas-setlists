            <h2>It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas</h2>
            It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br />
            Everywhere you go;<br />
            Take a look at the five and ten<br />
            It's glistening once again<br />
            With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.<br />
            <br />
            It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br />
            Toys in every store<br />
            But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be<br />
            On your own front door.<br />
            <br />
            A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots<br />
            Is the wish of Barney and Ben;<br />
            Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk<br />
            Is the hope of Janice and Jen;<br />
            And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.<br />
            <br />
            It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br />
            Everywhere you go;<br />
            There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,<br />
            It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.<br />
            <br />
            It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;<br />
            Soon the bells will start,<br />
            And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing<br />
            Right within your heart<br />
            <br />
            It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br />
            Toys in every store<br />
            But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be<br />
            On your own front door.<br />
            <br />
            Sure it's Christmas once more...

            [Verse 1]<br />
            You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch<br />
            You really are a heel<br />
            You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr.
            Grinch<br />
            You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel<br />
            <br />
            [Verse 2]<br />
            You're a monster, Mr. Grinch<br />
            Your heart's an empty hole<br />
            Your brain is full of spiders, you've got garlic in your soul, Mr.
            Grinch<br />
            I wouldn't touch you with a thirty-nine-and-a-half-foot pole<br />
            <br />
            <s>[Verse 3]<br />
            You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch<br />
            You have termites in your smile<br />
            You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr.
            Grinch<br />
            Given a choice between the two of you<br />
            I'd take the seasick crocodile</s><br />
            <br />
            [Verse 4]<br />
            You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch<br />
            You're a nasty-wasty skunk<br />
            Your heart is full of unwashed socks, your soul is full of gunk, Mr.
            Grinch<br />
            The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote,
            "Stink, stank, stunk"<br />
            <br />
            <s>[Verse 5]<br />
            You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch<br />
            You're the king of sinful sots<br />
            Your heart's a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr.
            Grinch<br />
            Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most
            disgraceful assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable<br />

            Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul <br />
            With a corncob pipe and a button nose <br />
            And two eyes made out of coal <br />
            Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say <br />
            He was made of snow but the children know<br />
            that he came to life one day <br />
            There must have been some magic<br />
            in that old silk hat they found <br />
            For when they placed it on his head <br />
            He began to dance around <br />
            Frosty the snowman <br />
            Was alive as he could be <br />
            And the children say he could laugh and play<br />
            just the same as you and me <br />
            <br />
            (Thumpetty thump thump <br />
            Thumpety thump thump <br />
            Look at Frosty go <br />
            Thumpetty thump thump <br />
            Thumpety thump thump <br />
            Over the hills of snow)<br />
            <br />
            Frosty the snowman knew <br />
            The sun was hot that day <br />
            So he said <br />
            Let's run and <br />
            We'll have some fun <br />
            Now before I melt away <br />
            Down to the village <br />
            With a broomstick in his hand <br />
            Running here and there all around the square<br />
            Saying <br />
            Catch me if you can <br />
            <br />
            (He led them down the streets of town <br />
            Right to the traffic cop <br />
            And he only paused a moment when <br />
            He heard him holler) "Stop!" <br />
            For Frosty the snow man <br />
            Had to hurry on his way <br />
            But he waved goodbye saying <br />
            Don't you cry <br />
            I'll be back again some day <br />
            I'll be back again some day

            I never understood a single word he said<br />
            But I helped him a-drink his wine<br />
            And he always had some mighty fine wine<br />
            <br />

            Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea<br />
            Joy to you and me<br />
            <br />
            And if I were the king of the world<br />
            Tell you what I'd do<br />
            I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the war<br />
            Make sweet love to you<br />

            [Verse]<br />
            I was a ghost, I was alone<br />
            In the darkness, a pressured path (Hah)<br />
            Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe (Hah)<br />
            I was the queen that I'm meant to be (Ah)<br />
            I lived two lives, tried to play both sides<br />
            But I couldn't find my own place (Oh, oh)<br />
            Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild<br />
            But now that's how I'm getting paid, endlessly on stage<br />
            <br />

            [Pre-Chorus]<br />
            I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin'<br />
            Like I'm born to be<br />
            We dreamin' hard, we came so far<br />
            Now I believe<br />
            <br />

            [Chorus]<br />
            We're goin' up, up, up<br />
            It's our moment<br />
            You know together we're glowin'<br />
            Gonna be, gonna be golden<br />
            Oh, up, up, up<br />
            With our voices<br />
            Unbreakable forever<br />
            Gonna be, gonna be golden<br />

            Like I'm born to be<br />
            Oh, our time, no fears, no lies<br />
            That's who we're born to be<br />
            <br />

            [Bridge]<br />
            Waited so long to break these walls down<br />
            To wake up and feel like me<br />
            Put these patterns all in the past now<br />
            And finally live like the girl they all see<br />
            No more hiding, I'll be shining<br />
            Like I'm born to be<br />
            'Cause we are hunters, voices strong<br />
            And I know I believe<br />
            <br />

            [Chorus]<br />
            We're goin' up, up, up<br />
            It's our moment<br />
            You know together we're glowing<br />
            Gonna be, gonna be golden<br />
            Oh, up, up, up<br />
            With our voices<br />
            Unbreakable forever<br />
            Gonna be, gonna be golden<br />

            Oh, our time, no fears, no lies<br />
            That's who we're born to be<br />
            <br />

            [Outro]<br />
            You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden (Oh)<br />
            We're gonna be, gonna be (Oh)<br />
            Born to be, born to be glowin' (Oh)<br />
            We are shining brightly<br />
            You know that it's our time, no fears, no lies (Oh, oh)<br />
