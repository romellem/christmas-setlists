        Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues<br>
        My baby's gone, I have no friends<br>
        To wish me greetings once again<br>
        <br>
        Choirs will be singin' Silent Night<br>
        Christmas carols by candlelight<br>
        Please come home for Christmas, please come home for Christmas<br>
        If not for Christmas, by New Year's night<br>
        <br>
        Friends and relations send salutations<br>
        Sure as the stars shine above<br>
        But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas, my dear<br>
        Some time of year to be with the one you love<br>

        My winter nights are taken up by static<br>
        Stress and holiday shopping traffic<br>
        But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else<br>
        Just like magic<br>
        <br>
        In my heart is a Christmas tree farm<br>
        Where the people would come<br>
        To dance under sparkling lights<br>
        Bundled up in their mittens and coats<br>
        And the cider would flow<br>
        And I just wanna be there tonight<br>
        <br>
        Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon<br>
        Mistakes are forgiven<br>
        And everything is icy and blue<br>
        And you would be there too<br>
        <br>
        Under the mistletoe<br>
        Watching the fire glow<br>
        And telling me, "I love you"<br>
        Just being in your arms<br>
        Takes me back to that little farm<br>
        Where every wish comes true<br>
        <br>
        In my heart is a Christmas tree farm<br>
        There's a light in the barn<br>
        We'd run inside out from the cold<br>
        In the town, kids are dreaming of sleighs<br>
        And they're warm and they're safe<br>
        They wake to see a blanket of snow<br>
        <br>
        Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon<br>
        Mistakes are forgiven<br>
        And everything is icy and blue<br>
        And you would be there too<br>
        <br>
        Under the mistletoe<br>
        Watching the fire glow<br>
        And telling me, "I love you"<br>
        Just being in your arms<br>
        Takes me back to that little farm<br>
        Where every wish comes true<br>
        Baby, yeah<br>
        <br>
        And when I'm feeling alone<br>
        You remind me of home<br>
        Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        And when the world isn't fair<br>
        I'll pretend that we're there<br>
        Baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        (To you)<br>
        <br>
        Under the mistletoe (to you)<br>
        Watching the fire glow<br>
        And telling me, "I love you"<br>
        <br>
        Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (darling)<br>
        Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        I love you<br>
        Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)<br>
        Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas<br>
        Where every wish comes true<br>

        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
        Everywhere you go;<br>
        Take a look at the five and ten<br>
        It's glistening once again<br>
        With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.<br>
        <br>
        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
        Toys in every store<br>
        But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be<br>
        On your own front door.<br>
        <br>
        A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots<br>
        Is the wish of Barney and Ben;<br>
        Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk<br>
        Is the hope of Janice and Jen;<br>
        And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.<br>
        <br>
        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
        Everywhere you go;<br>
        There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,<br>
        It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.<br>
        <br>
        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;<br>
        Soon the bells will start,<br>
        And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing<br>
        Right within your heart<br>
        <br>
        It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas<br>
        Toys in every store<br>
        But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be<br>
        On your own front door.<br>
        <br>
        Sure it's Christmas once more...

        But you can do the job when you're in town<br>
        <br>
        Later on we'll conspire as we dream by the fire<br>

        (In the meadow we can build a snowman)<br>
        And pretend he's a circus clown<br>
        We have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman<br>
        Until the other kiddies knock him down<br>
        <br>
        Oh when it snows ain't it filling<br>
        Though your nose gets a chilling<br>
        We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way<br>

        You know Dasher and Dancer<br>
        And Prancer and Vixen<br>
        Comet and Cupid<br>
        And Donner and Blitzen<br>
        But do you recall<br>
        The most famous reindeer of all?<br>
        <br>
        Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer<br>
        Had a very shiny nose<br>
        And if you ever saw it<br>
        You would even say it glows<br>
        <br>
        All of the other reindeer<br>
        Used to laugh and call him names<br>
        They never let poor Rudolph<br>
        Join in any reindeer games<br>
        <br>
        Then one foggy Christmas Eve<br>
        Santa came to say<br>
        "Rudolph with your nose so bright<br>
        Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"<br>
        <br>
        Then how the reindeer loved him<br>
        As they shouted out with glee<br>
        "Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer<br>
        You'll go down in history!"<br>

        Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul <br>
        With a corncob pipe and a button nose <br>
        And two eyes made out of coal <br>
        Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say <br>
        He was made of snow but the children know<br>
        that he came to life one day <br>
        There must have been some magic<br>
        in that old silk hat they found <br>
        For when they placed it on his head <br>
        He began to dance around <br>
        Frosty the snowman <br>
        Was alive as he could be <br>
        And the children say he could laugh and play<br>
        just the same as you and me <br>
        <br>
        (Thumpetty thump thump <br>
        Thumpety thump thump <br>
        Look at Frosty go <br>

        Over the hills of snow)<br>
        <br>
        Frosty the snowman knew <br>
        The sun was hot that day <br>
        So he said <br>
        Let's run and <br>
        We'll have some fun <br>
        Now before I melt away <br>
        Down to the village <br>
        With a broomstick in his hand <br>
        Running here and there all around the square<br>
        Saying <br>
        Catch me if you can <br>
        <br>
        (He led them down the streets of town <br>
        Right to the traffic cop <br>
        And he only paused a moment when <br>
        He heard him holler) "Stop!" <br>
        For Frosty the snow man <br>
        Had to hurry on his way <br>
        But he waved goodbye saying <br>
        Don't you cry <br>
        I'll be back again some day <br>
        I'll be back again some day

        Now the jingle hop has begun<br>
        <br>
        Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock<br>
        Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time<br>
        Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square<br>
        In the frosty air<br>
        <br>
        What a bright time, it's the right time<br>
        To rock the night away<br>
        Jingle bell time is a swell time<br>
        To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh<br>
        <br>
        Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet<br>
        Jingle around the clock<br>
        Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet<br>
        That's the jingle bell rock<br>
        <br>
        Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <br>
        Jingle bell chime in jingle bell time <br>
        Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square<br>

        I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,<br>
        Just like the ones I used to know,<br>
        Where those treetops glisten, and children listen,<br>
        To hear sleigh bells in the snow, the snow<br>
        <br>
        Then, I-I-I am dreaming of a white Christmas,<br>
        With every Christmas card I write,<br>
        May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright,<br>
        And may all your Christmases be white.<br>
        <br>
